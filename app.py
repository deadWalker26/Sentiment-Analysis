        **Sentiment Analysis Result:**
        - **Sentiment:** {sentiment}
        - **Sentiment Score:** {sentiment_score:.2f}
        - **Subjectivity Score:** {subjectivity_score:.2f}
        
        ### Explanation:
        - **Sentiment Score:** The sentiment score ranges from -1 to 1.
            - A score closer to **1** indicates a **positive sentiment** (e.g., "Ashutosh is Legit!").
            - A score closer to **-1** indicates a **negative sentiment** (e.g., "I hate this world!").
            - A score around **0** indicates a **neutral sentiment** (e.g., "This College is okay.").
        
        - **Subjectivity Score:** The subjectivity score ranges from 0 to 1.
            - A score closer to **1** indicates that the text is **more subjective** (e.g., "I think this is the best movie ever!").
            - A score closer to **0** indicates that the text is **more objective** (e.g., "The movie was released in 2020.").
        
        ### Summary:
        Based on the analysis of the text you provided, the sentiment is classified as **{sentiment}**. 
        The sentiment score of **{sentiment_score:.2f}** indicates that the text leans towards being **{sentiment.lower()}**. 
        This suggests that the emotions conveyed in the text are predominantly **{sentiment.lower()}** in nature. 
        The subjectivity score of **{subjectivity_score:.2f}** indicates that the text is **{"more subjective" if subjectivity_score > 0.5 else "more objective"}**. 
        This means that the text contains personal opinions or feelings rather than just factual information based on the above paragraph. ðŸ˜œ
